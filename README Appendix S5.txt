--- Information about appendix S5

--- All these R scripts were used to obtain the results presented in the paper
--- Written in R version 3.6.0 (R Core Team, 2019)
--- "aervi_data.txt" contains the Aphidius ervi dataset used to build and check the model
--- The "Saved objects" folder contains saved R objects
----------- Parameters used for the simulation experiment (defined in the script "Defining variance treatments.R")
----------- Simulation results (tables of performance on each dataset from each algorithm) (obtained from "Simulation experiment.R")
------- These saved objects are used in the different scripts
--- To reproduce the experiment, the scripts must be executed in a certain order (see below)

---Script description
---- "1_Sugar model.R" builds the model used to simulate all datasets in the experiment
---- "2_Estimating A. ervi parameters.R" estimates model parameters on the A. ervi dataset
---------- Requires the document "aervi_data.txt" (see in the script)
---- "3_Checking the model.R" presents various ways to check that the model generates meaningful simulations
---------- Must be run after "1_Sugar model.R" and "2_Estimating A. ervi parameters.R"
---- "4_Defining variance treatments.R" defines and saves the different parameter sets used in the simulation experiment
---------- Must be run after "1_Sugar model.R" and "2_Estimating A. ervi parameters.R"
---- "5_simul.functions.R" builds the different functions used to handle and compare the performances of simulated datasets
---- "6_Simulation experiment.R" simulates all the datasets using the different parameter sets
---------- Must be run after "1_Sugar model.R" and "5_simul.functions.R"
---------- Beware: Running this script will take a very long time (probably several hours or days/treatment)
---------- Beware: If you run this script, this will replace the "Saved objects" already stored in the folder, although they sould be the same
---- "7_Plotting functions for simulated data.R" generates functions to easily analyse simulation results visually
---- "8_Simulation results & graphs.R" generates various graphs to analyse simulation results using the previous functions
---------- Must be run after "7_Plotting functions for simulated data.R"
---- "9_Noise Index calculation.R" calculates the "noise index" for each simulated datasets and analyse its correlation with model performance
---------- Must be run after "1_Sugar model.R" and "4_Defining variance treatments.R"
---- "10_Heatmap.R" creates a function to generate heatmaps, and generates different heatmaps
---------- Must be run after "7_Plotting functions for simulated data.R" and "8_Simulation results & graphs.R"
---- "11_KLD vs BC.R" analyses the difference between KLD and BC to interpret prediction performances (see Appendix S9 at the end of the document)
---------- Must be run after "1_Sugar model.R"
